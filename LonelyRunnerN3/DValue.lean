# Milestone 4: the D-value and the sampling principle

The view-obstruction **D-value** of a speed vector is
`D(v) = 1/2 − ML(v)`, where `ML` is the maximum loneliness from
`MaxLoneliness.lean`. The Lonely-Runner / view-obstruction *spectrum*
`S₁(n)` is precisely the set of D-values realized by `n`-runner systems,
so `D` is the central quantity of the whole project.

This file:

* defines `D` and derives `D v ∈ [0, 1/2]` directly from `ML_bounds`;
* proves the **sampling principle** `D v ≤ 1/2 − gap v t` for every
  single time `t` — i.e. evaluating the instantaneous gap at any one
  time certifies an *upper* bound on the D-value.

The sampling principle is the formal heart of the computer-assisted
spectrum verifications in the papers: the Rust/Python sweeps evaluate
`gap` on a fine grid of times and speeds to certify that no D-value
lands in a forbidden interval. Here that logic is mechanized: a single
gap evaluation is a sound upper bound on `D`. No `sorry`.
