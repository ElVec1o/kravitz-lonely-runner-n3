# Milestone 2: distance to the nearest integer

The atom of the entire Lonely-Runner / view-obstruction theory is the
function `‖x‖ = dist(x, ℤ)`, the distance from a real `x` to the nearest
integer. Maximum loneliness `ML(v) = sup_t min_i ‖v_i t‖` and the
D-value `D(v) = 1/2 − ML(v)` are both built directly on it.

We define `nearestIntDist x := min (Int.fract x) (1 - Int.fract x)`
(equivalently `min over n∈ℤ of |x − n|`, using that the fractional part
already reduces to `[0,1)`), and prove its three defining properties:

* `nearestIntDist_nonneg`  — `0 ≤ ‖x‖`
* `nearestIntDist_le_half` — `‖x‖ ≤ 1/2`   (the global maximum)
* `nearestIntDist_intCast` — `‖(n : ℝ)‖ = 0` for integer `n`

These are fully proven (no `sorry`) and form the base layer for the
future formalization of `ML` and the D-value.
