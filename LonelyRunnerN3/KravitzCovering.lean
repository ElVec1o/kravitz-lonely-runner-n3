# Kravitz Lemma 7.1: the double-band covering

For the determined pairing in Case B1, with `M = vᵢ+vⱼ` and step `j = u·v_k mod M`, we need
to place BOTH the pair-runner and the third runner in the `2/7`-band simultaneously:
`∃ ℓ ∈ [lo, hi]` with `ℓ·j mod M ∈ [lo, hi]`, where `[lo,hi] = [⌈2M/7⌉, ⌊5M/7⌋]`.
(The pair-runner condition is exactly `ℓ ∈ [lo,hi]`, since at `t = ℓu/M` we have
`‖t·vᵢ‖ = ‖ℓ/M‖`; the third runner condition is `ℓj mod M ∈ [lo,hi]`.)

This file builds the covering. The MAIN regime `3 ≤ j ≤ W+1` (where `W = hi-lo`) follows
from the arithmetic-progression pigeonhole `ap_hits_interval`: the AP `{ℓ·j : ℓ ∈ [lo,hi]}`
steps by `j ≤ W+1` (cannot skip a band of width `W`) and spans `≥ M` (a full period), so it
hits the band — and the hitting `ℓ` lies in `[lo,hi]` by construction. See
No `sorry`.

/-- **Double-band covering, main regime.** If `3 ≤ j ≤ (hi−lo)+1` (step fits the band, no
skip) and `M ≤ (hi−lo)·j` (the AP spans a full period), then some `ℓ ∈ [lo, hi]` has
`ℓ·j mod M ∈ [lo, hi]` too. Both runners land in the band. -/

/-- **Band symmetry `j ↔ M−j`.** The `2/7`-band is exactly symmetric (`lo + hi = M`, which
holds for every `M`). Since `ℓ·(M−j) ≡ −ℓ·j (mod M)` and `x ∈ [lo,hi] ↔ M−x ∈ [lo,hi]`, the
*same* `ℓ` that covers `j` covers `M−j` and vice versa. This reduces any `j` to `[1, M/2]`. -/

/-- **Middle regime `j` near `M/2`.** Here the single step `j > W+1` can skip the band, but
the *2-step* `ℓ = hi − 2t` moves `ℓ·j` by `−(M−2j)`, and `M−2j` is small (`< M/7` for `j`
near `M/2`). So the even-indexed AP doesn't skip, and if it spans a period
(`M ≤ ⌊(hi−lo)/2⌋·(M−2j)`, i.e. `M−2j ≳ 5`) it hits the band — with `ℓ = hi−2t ∈ [lo,hi]`. -/

/-- **Even-`ℓ` covering for `j` just below `M/2`.** If `2j + d = M` (so `2j ≡ −d mod M`) and
some `k` has `2k ∈ [lo,hi]` (pair-runner) and `k·d ∈ [lo,hi]` (so `ℓj ≡ −kd ∈ [lo,hi]` by the
band symmetry `lo+hi=M`), then `ℓ = 2k` covers. For small `d` such a `k` always exists (it sits
near the bottom of the band), which finishes Kravitz's case-3 residual for `d ∈ {1,2,3,4}`. -/

/-- **Odd-`ℓ` covering for `j` just below `M/2`.** For `ℓ = 2k+1` we have
`ℓj ≡ M + j − kd (mod M)` (one wraparound), so if `2k+1 ∈ [lo,hi]` and `M+j−kd ∈ [lo,hi]`
the cover holds. This finishes the `d = 5` (and `d = 7`) residual that even-`ℓ` just misses. -/

double-band cover holds, with `lo = ⌈2M/7⌉ = (2M+6)/7`, `hi = ⌊5M/7⌋ = 5M/7`. Dispatches on
`j` and `d = M−2j` to the seven covering lemmas: edges `j∈{1,2}`; `main` for `3 ≤ j ≤ W+1`;
and for `j > W+1`, `even` (`d∈{1,2,3,4}`), `odd` (`d∈{5,6,7}`), `mid` (`d ≥ 8`). Coverage of

pair-runner and the third runner `≥ 2/7` from the integers. Reduces `j > M/2` to the low half

`M ∈ {5,11}` are excluded by `M ≥ 12`; verified exhaustively to `M < 3000`.) -/

Every residue here is `> 2M/7` and `< 5M/7`, so `‖·/M‖ > 2/7` *strictly*. The same generic
covering lemmas apply; the assembly requires `M ≥ 33` (for `r>30` the relevant pair-sums are
always `≥ 33`) and two direct-witness patches at `(M,j) = (37,15), (43,18)`. Verified covering
