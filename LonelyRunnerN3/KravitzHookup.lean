# Hooking the complete covering (`double_band_cover`) into the ML engine

`ML_ge_sweep_cover` is the modular-inverse sweep with the range/span hypotheses of
`ML_ge_sweep_inverse` *replaced* by the unconditional `double_band_cover` (Kravitz Lemma 7.1).
For a coprime comb `p·a + (p+r)·b = 1` with pair-sum `p+r ≥ 12` and inverse step
`s = q·a mod (p+r)` satisfying `0 < s` and `2s ≠ p+r` (both automatic when `gcd(s, p+r)=1`),
we get `ML(p,q,r) ≥ 2/7` — *with no resonance escape hatch*. This is the genuine
comparable-regime closure: the covering `ℓ` lands both the `p`-runner (`ℓ ∈ band`) and the
`q`-runner (`ℓ·s − c·M ∈ band`) in the `2/7`-band of the pair-sum modulus simultaneously,
which is exactly what `ML_ge_fullband_k` consumes. No `sorry`.

For a sorted triple `0 < p < q < r` with `r > 30` and primitivity in the usable form
`IsCoprime p (gcd q r)` and `IsCoprime q (gcd p r)`, we have `ML(p,q,r) ≥ 2/7`, i.e.
`D(p,q,r) ≤ 3/14`. Since every triple in `L₃` has `q+r ≤ 11 < 12 ≤ p+r`, `r > 30` already
guarantees non-`L₃`. The dispatch is on `g = gcd(q,r)`: `g=1` → `(q,r)` sweep; `g≥3` →
Case A on `(q,r)`; `g=2` (so `q,r` even, `p` odd) → on `gcd(p,r)`: `=1` → `(p,r)` sweep
(`p+r≠2q` by parity), `≥3` → Case A on `(p,r)` (`gcd(p,r)=2` is impossible, else `gcd(p,q,r)≥2`). -/
