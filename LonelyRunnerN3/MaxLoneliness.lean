# Milestone 3: maximum loneliness as a conditional supremum

Building on the nearest-integer-distance atom `‖·‖` of
`NearestInteger.lean`, we define, for a vector of integer speeds
`v : Fin (k+1) → ℤ` (the `+1` guarantees at least one runner):

* `gap v t = min over runners of ‖v_i · t‖` — the instantaneous
  loneliness at time `t` (a `Finset.inf'` over `Fin (k+1)`);
* `ML v = sSup_t gap v t` — the **maximum loneliness**, as a
  conditional supremum over all `t : ℝ`.

`ML` is the quantity from which the D-value `D(v) = 1/2 − ML(v)` of the
view-obstruction spectrum is defined. We prove the two facts that make
`ML` well-defined as a `sSup`:

* `gap` is bounded in `[0, 1/2]` (so the range is bounded above), and
* `ML v ∈ [0, 1/2]`.

The supremum is genuinely conditional (ℝ is only a conditionally
complete lattice), so boundedness is what makes `sSup` meaningful — this
is exactly what is established here. No `sorry`.
